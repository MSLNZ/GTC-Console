GUM Tree Calculator Console 
===========================

This is a project to produce a stand-alone Windows executable for GTC. The executable can be distributed and used without the need to have a Python installation. 

Background
==========

MSL first made GTC available as a Windows executable and called it GTC. This tool was distributed with the SciTE editor to help development. However, when a Python package for GTC was released we renamed the Windows executable GTC Console.

The Python tools we used to produce the original GTC Console have not been supported for some time and have become obsolete for later versions of Python. So, this project is an attempt to provide the executable with different tools.
 
Status
======

This GTC Console project is just starting. The first step will be to create a stand-alone Windows executable for GTC that will run on any Windows machine.
